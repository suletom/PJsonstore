# PJsonstore - minimal PHP array like structure with JSON serialization/deserialization

This project is minimalistic header library for arduino. The library uses a modified version of jsmn to parse JSON data and it can hold and modify the data in memory. Of course it can write data back to JSON. The object can be used similar to PHP array structure. The main purpuse was to create a global configuration object for an ESP8266 device to create webUI and store configured data to flash.

# Usage/examples

1. Download the [latest](https://github.com/suletom/PJsonstore/releases/download/v1.0.0/PJsonstore_v1.0.0.zip) release, and extract to your Arduino libraries directory!
2. Include the lib in your sketch. See the examples directory!
3. Basic usage example:
  
    #include <PJsonstore.h>
